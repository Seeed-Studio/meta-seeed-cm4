This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-seeed-cm4 layer.

# Supported Devices

This meta layer supports the following Seeed Studio devices:

- **seeed-reterminal**: reTerminal (Raspberry Pi CM4)
- **seeed-reterminal-DM**: reTerminal DM (Raspberry Pi CM4)
- **seeed-recomputer-r100x**: reComputer R100x (Raspberry Pi CM4)
- **seeed-recomputer-r110x**: reComputer R110x (Raspberry Pi CM4)
- **seeed-rerouter-cm4**: reRouter CM4 (Raspberry Pi CM4)
- **seeed-recomputer-r2x**: reComputer R2x (Raspberry Pi 5)

Each device has both standard and Mender-enabled variants for OTA updates.

# For more detail of project compiling

Please see the GitHub Actions workflow file:

- `.github/workflows/seeed-boards.yml`: Automated builds for all supported devices with Mender integration

## Building Images

You can build images for supported devices using the KAS configuration files in the `kas/` directory:

- `seeed-recomputer-r100x-mender.yml`: reComputer R100x with Mender
- `seeed-recomputer-r110x-mender.yml`: reComputer R110x with Mender
- `seeed-reterminal-mender.yml`: reTerminal with Mender  
- `seeed-reterminal-DM-mender.yml`: reTerminal DM with Mender
- `seeed-rerouter-cm4-mender.yml`: reRouter CM4 with Mender
- `seeed-recomputer-r2x-mender.yml`: reComputer R2x with Mender

After several hours of compiling, you can get the image in `build/tmp/deploy/images/<machine-name>/` with `.wic.bz2` suffix.
